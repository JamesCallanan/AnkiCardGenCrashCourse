# AnkiCardGenCrashCourse
Code used to make Anki Deck out of flash card data from crash course anatomy and physiology app. Would work with other flash card decks from this app, assuming app directory structure has not changed since Nov 2021.


Note for Anki shared deck...
Cards ported from Crash course app using code which can be found at https://github.com/JamesCallanan/AnkiCardGenCrashCourse
